# Space-Invaders-with-JavaScript
I am currently trying to make a webpage-based Space Invaders game, using JavaScript and JQuery. It won't be a perfect solution but will demonstrate my thinking during the process I try to build it.

√ Game field setting
√ Using the keyboard to control the defender movement 
√ Able to shoot missiles from the defender
√ Using js to generate the whole group of aliens
√ The aliens move together as a group 
  * there is a small problem, the alien group returns before actually touching the border, to be fixed
√ Bullet drop from a random alien

Tried to write function to hide the alien when it collides with the missile, but it seems to have some issue with the checkCollision function. to be fixed

Also, restructure a bit the logic to detect and hide the hit side.
